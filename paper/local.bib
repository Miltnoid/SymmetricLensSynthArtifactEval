abstract="Data integration is a key issue for any integrated set of software tools. A typical CASE environment, for instance, offers tools for the manipulation of requirements and software design documents, and it provides more or less sophisticated assistance for keeping these documents in a consistent state. Up to now, almost all data consistency observing or preserving integration tools are hand-crafted due to the lack of generic implementation frameworks and the absence of adequate specification formalisms. Triple graph grammars are intended to fill this gap and to support the specification of interdependencies between graph-like data structures on a very high level. Furthermore, they are the fundamentals of a new machinery for the production of batch-oriented as well as incrementally working data integration tools.",

abstract="Recent work has shown that the extraction of symbolic rules improves the generalization performance of recurrent neural networks trained with complete (positive and negative) samples of regular languages. This paper explores the possibility of inferring the rules of the language when the network is trained instead with stochastic, positive-only data. For this purpose, a recurrent network with two layers is used. If instead of using the network itself, an automaton is extracted from the network after training and the transition probabilities of the extracted automaton are estimated from the sample, the relative entropy with respect to the true distribution is reduced.",
